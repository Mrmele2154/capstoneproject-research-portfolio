# PSY 441 Capstone Project

### Mindy R. Mele

## Introduction

This repository contains all of the data, materials, and documents used in order to complete the experiment. The data come from my [Google Forms Influences on Goal Orientation Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13up91gdLWo-2HG7FHqiRYCz_CzbS0Rxida7eLTKutD0/viewform). They were processed and analyzed in R. A poster presentation was created with the results of these analyses.
